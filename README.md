# Project: Analyzing the Impact of OPEC Membership on Crude Oil Production and Economic Output (1985-2022)

For context, OPEC is the pact of small oil exporting nations (Saudia Arabia, Qatar... ext.) that projects their market prices. Their website provides dozens of datasets for people to study (linked here: https://asb.opec.org/data/ASB_Data.php). 

Some specific questions to explore: 
1. How do nations economic output change after joining/leaving OPEC (ex: GDP per capita)?
2. How much does OPEC membership status inlcuence a nation's oil output (i.e. OPEC+ vs OPEC members)?
3. Have OPEC nations economics become more dependent on oil export over time?
